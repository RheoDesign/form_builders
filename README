FormBuilders
============

The form_builders plugin provides a few standard form styles for you to use
with +form_for+ or +remote_form_for+. So far, we just have +tabular_form_for+
which produces a form inside a table, with two columns, one which has the
labelled human name of the field, one of which has the actual field input box.

TODO
====

* Write some documentation!
* Write some tests!
* Create some more form styles.
